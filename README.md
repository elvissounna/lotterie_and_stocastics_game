# Euromillions Lottery Number Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook explores the possibility of predicting Euromillions lottery numbers using machine learning.  It's crucial to understand that lottery numbers are randomly generated, and no model can guarantee accurate predictions. This notebook serves as a demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to a time-series dataset, and the results should be interpreted with extreme caution.  **Do not use this for gambling or financial decisions.**

## Data Preparation

1. **Data Loading and Combination:** The notebook begins by loading multiple CSV files containing historical Euromillions lottery data. These files are combined into a single Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning:**  The `date_de_tirage` column is converted to datetime format, and any errors during the conversion are handled gracefully. Missing dates are filled with the minimum date in the dataset.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Several features are engineered to improve prediction accuracy. These include:
    - Day of the week
    - Month, year, and week of the year
    - Lagged features (previous winning numbers)


## Model Training

A RandomForestRegressor is trained to predict the next set of lottery numbers. The model is trained on historical data using a train-test split to evaluate performance.


## Prediction

The trained model is used to predict the lottery numbers for the next draw. The input features for the next draw are taken from the last recorded draw in the dataset.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE).  Note that MSE is just one metric among many, and different metrics could be used, depending on how you define "accurate" prediction.

## Further Analysis and Improvements

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Hyperparameter optimization could be explored using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to improve the model's performance.

2. **Model Evaluation Metrics:** More comprehensive evaluation metrics should be explored.

3. **Feature Importance:** Analyze feature importance to determine the most influential features for prediction.

4. **More Sophisticated Models:**  Consider other prediction models like Gradient Boosting or neural networks for potential improvements.

## Disclaimer

This notebook is for educational purposes only. The predictions generated by this model should not be considered reliable or used for gambling.
